7-8    variable names are unclear, I'm not really sure what dx and dy are used for

19-22     comment the paddleUp/Down declarations, it's easy to figure out what they mean after you look at the key methods

   but the two are far enough away that some preliminary warning would be nice.

30-36    comment the circle stuff so It's more clear why you have a bunch of circle variables

38-40    Maybe move these declarations somewhere else so that you can easily see how the circle variables and setup() connect

Overall

It is confusing how the abbreviations p1 and p2 are used to represent both player 1/2 in the score variables(26-27)

and paddle 1/2 in the edge variables(95-101)

Where you do put comments it's very helpful but a few more would definitely increase your code's readability.

Especially before methods and blocks of if statements

For the most part your variables are well named, except for the ones I already mentioned.
